This is a party game of deception that consists of alternating rounds of “morning”, “noon” and “night” phases. 

## The first morning

### all players

Players know their own names (See [Table 1 “agents”](#table-1-agents)), identities (See [Table 2 “roles”](#table-2-roles)) and teams (See [Table 3 “teams”](#table-3-teams)), for example one player is named Adil, he is a werewolf and is a member of Team Werewolves. Players know the composition of the village, for example they know there is 1 werewolf, 1 seer and 3 villagers. Players gather in the village and discuss who to put to death.

### mason

The number of masons in the village is zero or two. If there are two masons in the village, they know their respective identities.

## Noon

### alive players

Players can vote to put someone to death. The most voted player is put to death. If two or more players tie for the most voted place, the LiCOS randomly chooses one. The dead player becomes a ghost who cannot talk with alive players, but can talk with other ghosts in the graveyard of the village.

## Night

### Werewolves

The werewolves vote to attack someone. If the most voted player is a werehamster or guarded by the hunter, nothing happens. Otherwise, they die. If two or more players tie for the most voted place, the LiCOS randomly chooses one. The dead player becomes a ghost who cannot talk with alive players, but can talk with other ghosts in the graveyard of the village.

### Seer

The seer can choose one player to learn the truth about. If the chosen player is the werehamster, it dies because of fear.

### Hunter

The hunter can choose one player to guard.

### Other alive players

Other alive players wait until morning comes.

## From the second morning on

### all players

Players know
1. Who died during the night.
2. Who was put to death at noon the day before.
3. The number of votes to be put to death each player received the day before.

### alive players

Players gather in the village and discuss who to put to death.

### seer

If the seer is still alive, they know whether their chosen player is a werewolf or not.

### medium

If the medium is still alive, they know whether the dead players were werewolves or not.
