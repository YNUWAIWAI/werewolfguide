The players in Team Villagers are trying to figure out who are the werewolves, while the werewolves are pretending to be in Team Villagers and trying to throw suspicion on real players. The seer is trying to throw suspicion on any werewolf they discover, but without revealing themselves (if they do, the werewolves will certainly attack them at night, since they are the werewolves’ greatest threat). Obviously the seer can announce their identity at any time, if they think it’s worthwhile. On the other hand, a werewolf could also claim to be the seer. 
The players agreeing a lot should be considered suspicious.
Accusing someone of being a werewolf is suspicious, but not accusing anyone is even more suspicious.

If there is a hunter in the village, the seer may reveal their identity in the first morning because the hunter will keep them safe. However, a werewolf may pretend to be a seer. 
When multiple players identify themselves as seers, the villagers have to understand who the real seer is.

If there is no hunter in the village, the seer will probably not reveal their identity in the first morning because the werewolves will attack them at night. In this situation usually nobody identifies themselves as seers on the first day.
