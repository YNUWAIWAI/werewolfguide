## Game over

Repeat a round of morning, noon and night until the werewolves are all dead, or the number of werewolves and non-werewolf players is equal. In all cases, if the werehamster is still alive, it kills all the other players and Team Werehamster becomes the winner. If all the werewolves are dead, Team Villagers wins. If the number of werewolves and non-werewolf players is equal, the werewolves kill all the non-werewolf players and Team Werewolves wins. Note that the ghost in the victory team also wins.
